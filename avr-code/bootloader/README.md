Bootloader for limb board (ATtiny841)
=====================================

Modified TinySafeBoot by Julien Thomas http://jtxp.org/tech/tinysafeboot_en.htm
	* Added transmit-enable toggling functionality and modified
	  to compile with AVRA

Use the TSB tools from Julien to program.

Requires official AVR Studio assembler (untested) or AVRA
with patch for ATtiny841 support for compilation.

Binary include in source repository because it's a bitch to produce.
